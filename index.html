    <h1 class="title">How I'm skipping RRTK</h1>
    <!-- <p class="subtitle">Subtitle</p> -->

    <p>This post is about how I study Japanese vocabulary with <b>no prior kanji study (RRTK).</b></p>

    <p>First, I'll go over some approaches I've tried and didn't like. Then, I'll explain my current method, and how it resolves the problems I had with the other approaches.</p>

    <h3>The 'vibes' approach (didn't work).</h3>

    <p>This is the first thing I thought of trying, when I had no experience with the SRS. I decided <b>I would completely ignore the radicals.</b> I would just look at the vague shape of the word and guess the answer. Then hope that it sticks.</p>

    <p>My cards looked something like this.</p>

    <table class="anki-card">
        <tr>
            <th><i>Front</i></th>
            <td class="centered">
                <div class="kanji">交通</div>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><i>Back</i></th>
            <td>
                <div class="reading">
                    <span class="pitch">
                        <span class="l">こ</span>
                        <span class="h">う</span>
                        <span class="h">つ</span>
                        <span class="h">う</span>
                    </span>
                </div>
                <p>traffic, transportation, communication, exchange (of ideas, etc.)</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>I very quickly realised that, without RRTK, this approach is terrible. My answers were no better than random chance. I didn't learn anything.</p>

    <h3>Incorporating RRTK stories (too hard).</h3>

    <p>Next, I decided to try incorporating RRTK. I would recall the RRTK keyword for each kanji <b>in addition to</b> the word itself.</p>

    <p>My cards now looked like this.</p>

    <table class="anki-card">
        <tr>
            <th><i>Front</i></th>
            <td class="centered">
                <div class="kanji">交通</div>
            </td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><i>Back</i></th>
            <td>
                <div class="reading">
                    <span class="pitch">
                        <span class="l">こ</span>
                        <span class="h">う</span>
                        <span class="h">つ</span>
                        <span class="h">う</span>
                    </span>
                </div>
                <p>traffic, transportation, communication, exchange (of ideas, etc.)</p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">交</span> &nbsp; If your <i>dad</i> (父) is outside <i>(wearing a hat, 亠),</i> he will <b>MINGLE</b> with the neighbours.</p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">通</span> &nbsp; Those who <i>use</i> (用) the <i>road</i> (⻌) are <b>TRAFFIC.</b></p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>This worked a lot better. Unlike the 'vibes' approach, with RRTK you actually <b>utilise the radicals.</b> My retention rate was high. But there was still an issue.</p>

    <p>The reviews were hard. Recalling two RRTK keywords alongside the vocabulary is <b>time consuming.</b> The speed at which I could learn new words was very limited. I needed an easier approach.</p>

    <h3>Half RRTK, half vibes (just right).</h3>

    <p>This approach is a balance of the previous two, and it's what I still use to this day. <b>I only include an RRTK story for one kanji, and I ignore the other kanji.</b></p>

    <p>My cards now look like this.</p>

    <table class="anki-card">
        <tr>
            <th><i>Front</i></th>
            <td class="centered">
                <div class="kanji">頻度</div>
            </td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><i>Back</i></th>
            <td>
                <div class="reading">
                    <span class="pitch">
                        <span class="h">ひ</span>
                        <span class="l">ん</span>
                        <span class="l">ど</span>
                    </span>
                </div>
                <p>frequency (of occurrence) e.g. weekly, daily, monthly, etc.</p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">頻</span> &nbsp; Going for <i>walks</i> (歩) is good for your <i>head</i> (頁) if you go <b>REPEATEDLY.</b></p>
                <span class="note">
                    <i>No story for 度</i>
                </span>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Ignoring one of the kanji in the word <b>reduces the workload significantly,</b> and I haven't seen any drop in my retention rates!</p>

    <p>Occasionally, words will 'clash' and share the chosen kanji.</p>

    <div class="centered">
        <div class="kanji">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">
                <span class="highlight">頻</span>度
            </span> &nbsp; <span class="reading"><span class="pitch">
                <span class="h">ひ</span>
                <span class="l">ん</span>
                <span class="l">ど</span>
            </span></span>
        </div>
        <div class="kanji">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">
                <span class="highlight">頻</span>繁
            </span> <span class="reading"><span class="pitch">
                <span class="l">ひ</span>
                <span class="h">ん</span>
                <span class="h">ぱ</span>
                <span class="h">ん</span>
            </span></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>I have these two words in my deck, and for both of them, I chose to focus on the kanji 頻. So how do I tell them apart?</p>
        
    <p><b>This is where 'vibes' come in.</b> 'Vibes' weren't effective for identifying the entire word. But when RRTK is applied to one kanji, it narrows down the possibilities significantly, and 'vibes' is just enough to cross the finish line.</p>
    
    <p>This is how my internal dialogue might sound while reviewing these cards.</p>

    <div class="tip">
    <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 18px;">I know the first kanji means 'repeatedly,' so it's either
    <span class="pitch">
                <span class="h">ひ</span>
                <span class="l">ん</span>
                <span class="l">ど</span>
            </span>
        or
        <span class="pitch">
                <span class="l">ひ</span>
                <span class="h">ん</span>
                <span class="h">ぱ</span>
                <span class="h">ん</span>
            </span>
    <b>(RRTK)</b>.</li>

    <li>
        The second kanji has loads of strokes, so... I'll say
        <span class="pitch">
                <span class="l">ひ</span>
                <span class="h">ん</span>
                <span class="h">ぱ</span>
                <span class="h">ん</span>
            </span>
        <b>(vibes)</b>.
    </li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Conclusion.</h3>

    <p>I'm really excited about this trick. Thanks to this, I've been able to skip the RRTK phase, and jump straight into vocabulary study. I hope anyone who is struggling with RRTK finds this helpful.</p>
