    <h1 class="title">How I'm skipping RRTK</h1>
    <!-- <p class="subtitle">Subtitle</p> -->

    <p>This post is about how I study Japanese vocabulary with <b>no prior kanji study (RRTK).</b></p>

    <p>First, I'll go over some approaches I've tried and <b>didn't like.</b> Then, I'll explain my current method, and how it <b>resolves the problems</b> I had with the other approaches.</p>

    <h3>The 'vibes' approach (didn't work).</h3>

    <p>This is the first thing I thought of trying, when I had no experience with the SRS. I <b>wouldn't use any conscious process.</b> I would just look at the vague shape of the word and guess the answer, purely based on intuition. Then hope it sticks.</p>

    <p>My cards looked something like this.</p>

    <table class="anki-card">
        <tr>
            <th>Front</th>
            <th>Back</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="centered">
                <div class="kanji">交通</div>
            </td>
            <td>
                <div class="reading">
                    <span class="pitch">
                        <span class="l">こ</span>
                        <span class="h">う</span>
                        <span class="h">つ</span>
                        <span class="h">う</span>
                    </span>
                </div>
                <p>traffic, transportation, communication, exchange (of ideas, etc.)</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>I very quickly realised that, without RRTK, this approach is terrible. My answers were no better than random chance. I didn't learn anything.</p>

    <h3>Incorporating RRTK stories (too hard).</h3>

    <p>Next, I decided to try incorporating RRTK. I would recall the RRTK keyword for each kanji <b>in addition to</b> the word itself.</p>

    <p>My cards now looked like this.</p>

    <table class="anki-card">
        <tr>
            <th>Front</th>
            <th>Back</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="centered">
                <div class="kanji">交通</div>
            </td>
            <td>
                <div class="reading">
                    <span class="pitch">
                        <span class="l">こ</span>
                        <span class="h">う</span>
                        <span class="h">つ</span>
                        <span class="h">う</span>
                    </span>
                </div>
                <p>traffic, transportation, communication, exchange (of ideas, etc.)</p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">交</span> &nbsp; If your <i>dad</i> (父) is outside <i>(wearing a hat, 亠),</i> he will <b>MINGLE</b> with the neighbours.</p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">通</span> &nbsp; Those who <i>use</i> (用) the <i>road</i> (⻌) are <b>TRAFFIC.</b></p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>This worked a <b>lot</b> better. Unlike the 'vibes' approach, with RRTK you actually <b>utilise the radicals,</b> rather than ignoring them. I actually remembered the cards. But there was still an issue.</p>

    <p>The reviews were hard. It is a <b>lot</b> of work to recall two RRTK keywords alongside the vocabulary. Especially since this approach results in doing RRTK out of order, which is even tougher.</p>

    <p>The speed I could learn new words was very limited. I needed an easier approach.</p>

    <h3>Half RRTK, half vibes (just right).</h3>

    <p>This is the method I currently use. Simply put, I <b>only learn one RRTK story</b> from the word, and I leave the other kanji up to 'vibes' (effectively ignore it).</p>

    <p>My cards now look like this.</p>

    <table class="anki-card">
        <tr>
            <th>Front</th>
            <th>Back</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="centered">
                <div class="kanji">頻度</div>
            </td>
            <td>
                <div class="reading">
                    <span class="pitch">
                        <span class="h">ひ</span>
                        <span class="l">ん</span>
                        <span class="l">ど</span>
                    </span>
                </div>
                <p>frequency (of occurrence) e.g. weekly, daily, monthly, etc.</p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">頻</span> &nbsp; Going for <i>walks</i> (歩) is good for your <i>head</i> (頁) if you go <b>REPEATEDLY.</b></p>
                <span class="highlight">
                    <i>No story for 度.</i>
                </span>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>This allows for <b>making use of the radicals</b> without requiring the <b>extra effort</b> of writing and recalling two stories.</p>

    <p><i>Occasionally,</i> there is another word in the deck which shares the chosen kanji. In this case, I also have this word</p>

    <div class="centered">
        <div class="kanji">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">
                <span class="highlight">頻</span>度
            </span> &nbsp; <span class="reading"><span class="pitch">
                <span class="h">ひ</span>
                <span class="l">ん</span>
                <span class="l">ど</span>
            </span></span>
        </div>
        <div class="kanji">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">
                <span class="highlight">頻</span>繁
            </span> <span class="reading"><span class="pitch">
                <span class="l">ひ</span>
                <span class="h">ん</span>
                <span class="h">ぱ</span>
                <span class="h">ん</span>
            </span></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>which I use <b>the same RRTK story</b> to memorise.</p>
        
    <p><b>This is where 'vibes' come in.</b> Because this is so uncommon, simply 'eyeballing' the shape of the second kanji is enough for me to tell the difference between them.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion.</h3>

    <p>I'm really excited about this trick. I think it incorporates <b>just</b> enough RRTK to be effective, without bogging down speed of progress.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks to this, I've been able to accelerate my progress of learning to read right from my first few weeks of using Anki.</p>
